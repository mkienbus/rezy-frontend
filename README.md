# Restaurant Tracker App
## Description:
This application is meant to be a demonstration of the skills I have learned so far in my programming course. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database, Ruby on Rails backend, and the React framework for the frontend. My focus on this application was the functionality between the back and front ends, without a heavy focus on the front/styling.  
## Requirements:  
| Requirement | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Ruby | 2.7.4 |
| PostgreSQL | 14.1 |
| Node | 16.13.2 |
| React | 17.0.2|

## Installation:
- **Ruby**:  
  Run `rvm install 2.7.4 --default`  
  Also install the latest versions of bundler and rails
  ```
  gem install bundler
  gem install rails
  ```
- **PostgreSQL**  
  Easily installable on OSX with homebrew.  
  Run `brew install postgresql`  
  After installation is complete, run `brew services start postgresql` to start Postgres services.  
- **Node**  
  Run
  ```
  nvm install 16
  nvm use 16
  ```
  to install and set node 16 as default. 
- **React**  
  Run `npm install react@17.0.2`


## Usage
- The application initially directs the user to a login page, with an option to create a username for new users. If you do not run `rails db:seed` to populate with the provided seed file, you can create your own username at this time.

##### (note: there is no password authentication on this application)

- After logging in or creating a username to login with, you are directed to the home page which renders a list of all your restaurants and their attributes.  
  
![home](./images/home.png)  
- The home page also has a navigation bar and logout button at the top. You can also edit information on the rendered items in your list.

## Roadmap  
I would like to add password authentication to this application in the near future.
